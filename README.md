# 1 Main Content
This study addresses the issues of local optima and excessive computational overhead in high-resolution maps encountered in robotic path planning. We propose an improved method that, without altering the core path planning algorithm, introduces a preprocessing module and a postprocessing module to reduce computational load and enhance path quality, respectively. Path validation was conducted in Gazebo, demonstrating that the added preprocessing and postprocessing modules are compatible with nearly all path planning algorithms. Our code also supports modular adaptation for commonly used path planning algorithms. For different cost map resolutions and planning algorithms, flexible interfaces have been implemented in the launch files, allowing users to make adjustments simply by modifying the launch fileâ€”without needing to alter the original algorithms or robot execution files to adjust cost map resolution scaling.
# 2 Approach for Improvement
The preprocessing module ensures the safety of the path planning algorithm by inflating the obstacle map, avoiding the complexity of traditional adaptive distance-maintenance methods and improving computational speed. The postprocessing module, based on keypoint extraction, reduces the numerous path points to a set of essential key points, thereby mitigating issues with local optimal paths.
# 3 Operating Environment
This study was conducted on a Linux system running Ubuntu 20.04. Please ensure your environment matches Ubuntu 20.04. The compatibility of this source code with Ubuntu 18.04 has not been tested; use on Ubuntu 18.04 carries potential risks.
